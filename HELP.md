# Help section for the AnalogWay Midra module

With this module you can control all graphic switchers from the Midra series by AnalogWay, e.g. the Pulse2.
Midra Series devices allow only one connection to the ethernet port at the same time. So you can either use RCS2 or Companion, but not both simultaneous. If you want to connect both at the same time you have to use a connection proxy like the AW Gateway app from Analog Way.
This module only supports ethernet connections to port 10500 of the device, serial connections are not supported.

When working with memories keep in mind, that only eight memories are stored on the device. That means you can't use the additional memories provided by RCS2 from anything else than RCS2 itself. Only the first eight memories are available from Companion.
